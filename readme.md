# About me 關於我


## CV
Hello, my name is Jin-Cheng Lee. I am currently a junior majoring in Electrical Engineering at Chung Yuan Christian University. I hail from Keelung, and my father works at Dell Inc., while my mother is a homemaker. During my junior high school years, my father introduced me to the world of wireless communications by gifting me an Arduino developer kit, sparking my curiosity and passion for the field.
