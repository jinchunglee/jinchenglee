# About me 關於我


## CV
Hello, my name is Jin-Cheng Lee. I am currently a junior majoring in Electrical Engineering at Chung Yuan Christian University. I hail from Keelung, and my father works at Dell Computers, while my mother is a homemaker. During my junior high school years, my father introduced me to the world of wireless communications by gifting me an Arduino developer kit, sparking my curiosity and passion for the field.

Throughout my university years, I have actively pursued my interests, especially during my coursework in communications principles, where I excelled and received the Excellent Subject Award. Additionally, I joined the Chung Yuan University RF Lab as a research assistant, providing me with practical learning and research opportunities.

1. Research Assistant Experience
    - MR Mechanical Arm Teaching System (MetaACES Acceptance)
    I was involved in the development of a system using HoloLens 2 aimed at instructing users on how to operate robotic
    arms. I was responsible for the system’s design, development, and testing, and actively participated in integrating real robotic arm functionalities. This project deepened my understanding of the integration between mixed reality technologies and mechanical control, along with the challenges and solutions in practical applications.

    - Campus VR Tour System (IEEE ECICE Acceptance)
    In this project, I collaborated with international students to develop a digital twin system for the campus. I served as the team leader, responsible for system design, development, and coordinating the progress. Our work was successfully presented at IEEE ECICE, where we received the Best Paper award.
