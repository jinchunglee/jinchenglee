# About me 關於我


## CV
Hello, my name is Jin-Cheng Lee. I am currently a junior majoring in Electrical Engineering at Chung Yuan Christian University. I hail from Keelung, and my father works at Dell Computers, while my mother is a homemaker. During my junior high school years, my father introduced me to the world of wireless communications by gifting me an Arduino developer kit, sparking my curiosity and passion for the field.


## Research Experience 

Throughout my university years, I have actively pursued my interests, especially during my coursework in communications principles, where I excelled and received the Excellent Subject Award. Additionally, I joined the Chung Yuan University RF Lab as a research assistant, providing me with practical learning and research opportunities.

1. Research Assistant Experience
    - MR Mechanical Arm Teaching System (MetaACES Acceptance)
    I was involved in the development of a system using HoloLens 2 aimed at instructing users on how to operate robotic
    arms. I was responsible for the system’s design, development, and testing, and actively participated in integrating real robotic arm functionalities. This project deepened my understanding of the integration between mixed reality technologies and mechanical control, along with the challenges and solutions in practical applications.

    - Campus VR Tour System (IEEE ECICE Acceptance)
    In this project, I collaborated with international students to develop a digital twin system for the campus. I served as the team leader, responsible for system design, development, and coordinating the progress. Our work was successfully presented at IEEE ECICE, where we received the Best Paper award.

    - Sidelobe Reduction (IEEE ICASI Acceptance)
    I contributed to a project focused on optimizing antenna performance. We proposed a new antenna architecture that optimizes the farfield without adjusting the signal processing, thus reducing sidelobe issues. My role primarily involved theoretical analysis, and our findings were published at IEEE ICASI.

    - Research on Beamforming Array Optimization
    I am currently engaged in research on optimizing beamforming arrays without altering the original antenna structures, aiming to achieve signal processing objectives by adjusting the antenna arrangements. This research is ongoing.

    - 8x8 MIMO Mobile Antenna Integration with Machine Learning
    Furthermore, I am involved in a project on MIMO mobile antennas, where post- design, we use machine learning techniques to optimize the antenna spacing to enhance system performance and efficiency.

2. VLSI Design Experience
    - VLSI System Design Internship Course(Yu-Hsin, Inc.)
    I learned to operate the Laker layout tool, understood industry-standard layout guidelines (DRC, LVS, PEX), and practiced circuit layout.

    - Chung Yuan University IC Summer Camp
    I acquired skills in Full Custom Design, starting from circuit design using Virtuoso, to Laker layout, and finally verification with Calibre.


## Extracurricular Activities

1. IC design camp  
    在參加了由中原電子所舉辦的IC設計營隊後，我對IC設計有了更深入的了解。這個營隊涵蓋了以下幾個重要環節：

1. **電路設計 (Virtuoso)**
2. **電路模擬 (Hspice)**
3. **Layout設計 (Laker/Virtuoso)**
4. **Calibre驗證 (DRC/LVS/PEX)**
