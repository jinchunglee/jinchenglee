## Research Experience 

Throughout my university years, I have actively pursued my interests, especially during my coursework in communications principles, where I excelled and received the Excellent Subject Award. Additionally, I joined the Chung Yuan University RF Lab as a research assistant, providing me with practical learning and research opportunities.

1. Research Assistant Experience
    - MR Mechanical Arm Teaching System (MetaACES Acceptance)  
    I was involved in the development of a system using HoloLens 2 aimed at instructing users on how to operate robotic
    arms. I was responsible for the system’s design, development, and testing, and actively participated in integrating real robotic arm functionalities. This project deepened my understanding of the integration between mixed reality technologies and mechanical control, along with the challenges and solutions in practical applications.

    - Campus VR Tour System (IEEE ECICE Acceptance)  
    In this project, I collaborated with international students to develop a digital twin system for the campus. I served as the team leader, responsible for system design, development, and coordinating the progress. Our work was successfully presented at IEEE ECICE, where we received the Best Paper award.

    - Sidelobe Reduction (IEEE ICASI Acceptance)  
    I contributed to a project focused on optimizing antenna performance. We proposed a new antenna architecture that optimizes the farfield without adjusting the signal processing, thus reducing sidelobe issues. My role primarily involved theoretical analysis, and our findings were published at IEEE ICASI.

    - Research on Beamforming Array Optimization  
    I am currently engaged in research on optimizing beamforming arrays without altering the original antenna structures, aiming to achieve signal processing objectives by adjusting the antenna arrangements. This research is ongoing.

    - 8x8 MIMO Mobile Antenna Integration with Machine Learning  
    Furthermore, I am involved in a project on MIMO mobile antennas, where post- design, we use machine learning techniques to optimize the antenna spacing to enhance system performance and efficiency.

2. VLSI Design Experience
    - VLSI System Design Internship Course(Yu-Hsin, Inc.)  
    I learned to operate the Laker layout tool, understood industry-standard layout guidelines (DRC, LVS, PEX), and practiced circuit layout.

    - Chung Yuan University IC Summer Camp  
    I acquired skills in Full Custom Design, starting from circuit design using Virtuoso, to Laker layout, and finally verification with Calibre.


## Extracurricular Activities

1. IC design camp  
    在參加了由中原電子所舉辦的IC設計營隊後，我對IC設計有了更深入的了解。這個營隊涵蓋了以下幾個重要環節：

    1. **電路設計 (Virtuoso)**
    2. **電路模擬 (Hspice)**
    3. **Layout設計 (Laker/Virtuoso)**
    4. **Calibre驗證 (DRC/LVS/PEX)**

這個活動讓我對於Full Custom Design有了一個大致的了解，學會了製成檔的意義及如何操作相關的設計軟體。  

2. 予新科技VLSI實習課程
    在參加了IC設計營隊之後，我對IC設計產生了濃厚的興趣。為了進一步深入學習這一領域，我選擇加入了中原大學電子系鐘文耀教授開設的課程。該課程與予新科技合作，主要教授業界實際的佈局方法和技術。這段學習經歷不僅增強了我的專業知識，還讓我對IC設計的實踐應用有了更深入的瞭解。  

3. 龜山生態展
    此外，我還積極參與了許多與地方文化相關的活動。這些活動包括瞭解桃園的在地文化、探索洋樓的歷史以及欣賞傳統歌仔戲。我還有幸採訪了臺灣歌仔戲首席乾旦，通過這些經歷，我對舊文化的保存與新文化的影響有了更深的興趣。
